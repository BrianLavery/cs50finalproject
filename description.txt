Templates

All
 - Restart
 - Quiz
 - Leaderboard


Additional
 - Create difficulty levels, harder difficult gets more points (or just credit, or separate leaderboard)
 - Record time taken to complete quiz? (dependent on my code?)
 - Only give them 10 seconds to answer the question or automatically move on
 - Create a few different quizzes, e.g. a flags quiz and a borders quiz, maybe even a country shapes quiz (need to get another API for that)
